# üåç API Driven Real Time Global Indicators (Power BI Dashboard)

This project provides a **comprehensive analysis of global socio-economic and health indicators** using Power BI.  
It explores how countries are performing across key development dimensions such as **economic growth, health spending, technology adoption, poverty reduction, and sustainability**.

## üìä Key Research Objectives

1. **Understand the overall economic and social landscape**
   - Average GDP per capita (economic well-being).
   - Average trade value (international market activity).
   - Health expenditure as % of GDP (investment in health).
   - Average GDP growth rate (economic momentum).
   - Land proportion of total area (resource and agriculture context).

2. **Compare health spending patterns across regions**
   - Identify which regions prioritize health more relative to GDP.

3. **Analyze trends in socio-economic indicators**
   - Forest area, mobile subscriptions, internet subscriptions, inflation, renewable energy use, unemployment.

4. **Evaluate the impact of internet access on immunization awareness**
   - Correlation between internet penetration and immunization rates.

5. **Assess the role of internet access in reducing unemployment**
   - Investigate digital inclusion as a driver of employment opportunities.

6. **Identify underperforming countries in poverty reduction**
   - Bottom 10 countries with least progress in poverty reduction.

7. **Identify top-performing countries in poverty reduction**
   - Top 10 countries with the most progress in poverty reduction.

8. **Examine interrelationships among health indicators**
   - Health expenditure, life expectancy, immunization rates, child mortality, disease burden.

9. **Investigate the relationship between spending and life expectancy**
   - Trendline analysis of whether more spending improves life expectancy.

## üîë Key Insights
- Regions vary significantly in how much they spend on health relative to GDP.  
- Internet access shows strong correlation with higher immunization awareness.  
- Some countries remain stagnant in poverty reduction, while others demonstrate rapid improvement.  
- Health expenditure has a measurable (but not exclusive) role in increasing life expectancy.
